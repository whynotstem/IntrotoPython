    "## Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re new to programming, you might have two big questions:  \n",
    "1. What is a (computer) program?  \n",
    "2. What can you do by writing a (computer) program?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how I understand these questions:  \n",
    "- A program is an ordered collection of data and instructions.  \n",
    "- Writing a program means using data and instructions to control the computer to do what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, many people choose Python because it’s simple and powerful. Compared to languages like C, C++, or Java, Python is friendlier for beginners and non-professionals. Many problems can be solved in a simple and elegant way with Python. Let’s start by learning the basics of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Basic Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start learning Python, let’s talk about some basic computer concepts.  \n",
    "A computer’s hardware usually has five main parts:\n",
    "- Arithmetic unit (does calculations)\n",
    "- Control unit (manages instructions)\n",
    "- Memory (stores data)\n",
    "- Input devices (like keyboard, mouse)\n",
    "- Output devices (like monitor, printer)\n",
    "\n",
    "The arithmetic and control units together are called the CPU, which runs calculations and instructions. A program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory can be internal (RAM) or external (like hard drives). The CPU can directly use internal memory. When a program runs, its data and instructions are loaded into RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input and output devices are often called I/O devices. Keyboards, mice, microphones, and cameras are input devices. Monitors, printers, and speakers are output devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computers today use the “Von Neumann architecture.” This means:\n",
    "1. Memory and CPU are separate.\n",
    "2. Data is stored in binary (0s and 1s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary is a counting system that goes up by twos, just like decimal goes up by tens. Humans use decimal because we have ten fingers. The Mayans used base-20, probably because they counted their toes too! In computers, binary is easy to use because high voltage can mean 1, and low voltage can mean 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need to know binary to write programs, but it’s good to know that all data in a computer is stored as binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables and Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To store data in a computer’s memory, we use variables.  \n",
    "A variable is a name for a place in memory that holds data. You can read and change the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can handle many types of data, like numbers, text, images, audio, and video. Even though all data is binary inside the computer, we use different types of variables in Python to represent different kinds of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has several built-in data types. Here are the most common:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integer (int):** Whole numbers. Python can handle very big integers. You can write them in binary (like 0b100, which is 4 in decimal), octal (0o100, which is 64), decimal (100), or hexadecimal (0x100, which is 256).\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(0b100)  # 4\n",
    "  print(0o100)  # 64\n",
    "  print(100)    # 100\n",
    "  print(0x100)  # 256\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Float (float):** Numbers with decimals. You can also use scientific notation (like 1.23456e2, which is 123.456).\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(123.456)    # 123.456\n",
    "  print(1.23456e2)  # 123.456\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **String (str):** Text, written inside single or double quotes, like 'hello' or \"hello\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Boolean (bool):** Only two values: True or False. Use this for things that are yes/no, true/false, good/bad, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Naming Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Every variable needs a name, just like people do. In Python, variable names must follow these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "1. Names can use letters, numbers, and underscores, but can’t start with a number. Letters can be from any language, but it’s best to use English letters.\n",
    "2. Python is case-sensitive. 'A' and 'a' are different variables.\n",
    "3. Don’t use Python’s keywords (like is, if, else, for, while, True, False) or names of built-in functions (like int, print, input, str, math, os) as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventions:**\n",
    "1. Use lowercase letters. If the name has more than one word, use underscores (like my_variable).\n",
    "2. Variables starting with a single underscore are “protected.”\n",
    "3. Variables starting with two underscores are “private.”  \n",
    "   (Don’t worry about these for now; you’ll learn more later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to give variables meaningful names so others can understand your code easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
