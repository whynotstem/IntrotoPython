With such a structure, the code just now does not need to be written 3600 times, but written once and then put into the loop structure to repeat 3600 times. There are two ways to construct loop structures in Python language, one is the `for-in` loop, and the other is the `while` loop.\n",

The code block controlled by the `for-in` loop is called the loop body. Usually, the statements in the loop body will be executed repeatedly according to the loop settings."

    "> **Tip**: A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that can only be divided by 1 and itself. For example, for a positive integer $\\small{n}$, we can determine whether it is a prime number by looking for factors of $\\small{n}$ between 2 and $\\small{n - 1}$. Of course, the loop does not have to start from 2 and end at $\\small{n - 1}$, because for positive integers greater than 1, the factors should appear in pairs, so the loop can end when it reaches $\\small{\\sqrt{n}}$."

If factors of `num` are found, then it must not be a prime number.

However, if we use the above code, the loop will repeat `9999999999998` times, which is usually unacceptable. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor, which can help us get the desired result faster. The code is shown below."
