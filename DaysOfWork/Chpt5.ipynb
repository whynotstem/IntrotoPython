    "\n",
    "Before we start this lesson, we will give you a programming task, which is to roll a dice 6000 times and count the number of times each number appears. This task should be very simple for everyone. We can use random numbers uniformly distributed from 1 to 6 to simulate rolling the dice, and then use 6 variables to record the number of times each number appears. I believe that after learning the previous part, everyone can write the following code relatively smoothly.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't need to say how ugly the above code is. Of course, what's even more terrible is that if we want to roll two or more dice and count the number of times each number appears, we need to define more variables and write more branch structures, which makes everyone feel sick. At this point, I believe everyone has a question in their mind: Is there a way to use one variable to save multiple data, is there a way to use unified code to operate multiple data? The answer is yes. In Python language, we can use container variables to save and operate multiple data. First, we will introduce the new data type of list (`list`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a list\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a list is a data sequence consisting of a series of elements in a specific order, which means that if we define a variable of list type, we can use it to store multiple data. In Python, we can use the `[]` literal syntax to define a list, and multiple elements in the list are separated by commas. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items1 = [35, 12, 99, 68, 55, 35, 87]\n",
    "items2 = ['Python', 'Java', 'Go', 'Kotlin']\n",
    "items3 = [100, 12.3, 'Python', True]\n",
    "print(items1)  # [35, 12, 99, 68, 55, 35, 87]\n",
    "print(items2)  # ['Python', 'Java', 'Go', 'Kotlin']\n",
    "print(items3)  # [100, 12.3, 'Python', True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: A list can have repeated elements, such as `35` in `items1`; a list can have elements of different types, such as `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool` in `items3`. However, we usually do not recommend putting elements of different types in the same list, mainly because it is extremely inconvenient to operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `type` function to check the type of a variable. Interested friends can check what type the variable `items1` is. Because a list can store multiple elements, it is a container data type, so when we name a list type variable, the variable name usually uses a plural word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can also use Python's built-in `list` function to turn other sequences into lists. To be precise, `list` is not an ordinary function, it is a constructor that creates list objects. The following courses will introduce the concepts of objects and constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items4 = list(range(1, 10))\n",
    "items5 = list('hello')\n",
    "print(items4)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "print(items5)  # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explanation**: `range(1, 10)` will generate a sequence of integers from `1` to `9`. When given to the `list` constructor, a list consisting of integers from `1` to `9` will be created. A string is a sequence of characters. The above `list('hello')` uses the characters of the string `hello` as list elements to create a list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `+` operator to concatenate two lists. The concatenation operation will connect the elements of the two lists into one list. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items5 = [35, 12, 99, 45, 66]\n",
    "items6 = [45, 58, 29]\n",
    "items7 = ['Python', 'Java', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "print(items5 + items6)  # [35, 12, 99, 45, 66, 45, 58, 29]\n",
    "print(items6 + items7)  # [45, 58, 29, 'Python', 'Java', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "items5 += items6\n",
    "print(items5)  # [35, 12, 99, 45, 66, 45, 58, 29]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `*` operator to implement list repetition operations. The `*` operator will repeat the list elements a specified number of times. We add two lines to the above code as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(items6 * 3)  # [45, 58, 29, 45, 58, 29, 45, 58, 29]\n",
    "print(items7 * 2)  # ['Python', 'Java', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'Java', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `in` or `not in` operator to check whether an element is in the list or not. We add two more lines to the above code as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(29 in items6)  # True\n",
    "print(99 in items6)  # False\n",
    "print('C++' not in items7)     # True\n",
    "print('Python' not in items7)  # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are multiple elements in the list, and the elements are placed in the list in a specific order, when we want to operate an element in the list, we can use the `[]` operator to access the element by specifying the position of the element in `[]`. This operation is called an index operation. It should be noted that the element position of `[]` can be an integer from `0` to `N - 1`, or an integer from `-1` to `-N`, which are called forward index and reverse index respectively, where `N` represents the number of elements in the list. For forward index, `[0]` can access the first element in the list, and `[N - 1]` can access the last element; for reverse index, `[-1]` can access the last element in the list, and `[-N]` can access the first element. The code is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items8 = ['apple', 'waxberry', 'pitaya', 'peach', 'watermelon']\n",
    "print(items8[0])   # apple\n",
    "print(items8[2]) # pitaya\n",
    "print(items8[4])   # watermelon\n",
    "items8[2] = 'durian'\n",
    "print(items8)      # ['apple', 'waxberry', 'durian', 'peach', 'watermelon']\n",
    "print(items8[-5])  # 'apple'\n",
    "print(items8[-4])  # 'waxberry'\n",
    "print(items8[-1])  # watermelon\n",
    "items8[-4] = 'strawberry'\n",
    "print(items8)      # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'durian', 'peach', 'watermelon']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using index operations, we must avoid the situation where the index is out of bounds. For the above `items8`, if we access `items8[5]` or `items8[-6]`, an `IndexError` error will be triggered, causing the program to crash. The corresponding error message is: *list index out of range*, which means \"array index out of range\" in Chinese. Because for the list `items8` with only five elements, the valid forward index is `0` to `4`, and the valid reverse index is `-1` to `-5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to access multiple elements in a list at once, we can use the slice operation. The slice operation is an operator of the form `[start:end:stride]`, where `start` represents the starting position of the list elements to be accessed, `end` represents the end position of the list elements to be accessed (the elements at the end position cannot be accessed), and `stride` represents the span, which is simply the increment of the position. For example, if the first element we access is at the `start` position, then the second element is at the `start + stride` position, and of course `start + stride` must be less than `end`. We add the following statement to the above code to use the slice operator to access list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(items8[1:3:1])     # ['strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[0:3:1])     # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[0:5:2])     # ['apple', 'durian', 'watermelon']\n",
    "print(items8[-4:-2:1])   # ['strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[-2:-6:-1])  # ['peach', 'durian', 'strawberry', 'apple']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Reminder**: You can look at the last line in the above code and think about how the slice operation accesses elements when the stride is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `start` value is equal to `0`, it can be omitted when using the slice operator; if the `end` value is equal to `N`, `N` represents the number of list elements, it can be omitted when using the slice operator; if the `stride` value is equal to `1`, it can also be omitted when using the slice operator. Therefore, the following code has exactly the same effect as the above code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(items8[1:3])     # ['strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[:3:1])    # ['apple', 'strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[::2])     # ['apple', 'durian', 'watermelon']\n",
    "print(items8[-4:-2])   # ['strawberry', 'durian']\n",
    "print(items8[-2::-1])  # ['peach', 'durian', 'strawberry', 'apple']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, we can also modify the elements in the list through slicing operations. For example, if we add another line to the above code, you can see the output here.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items8[1:3] = ['x', 'o']\n",
    "print(items8)  # ['apple', 'x', 'o', 'peach', 'watermelon']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also perform relational operations on two lists. We can compare whether two lists are equal or compare the sizes of two lists. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "nums2 = list(range(1, 5))\n",
    "nums3 = [3, 2, 1]\n",
    "print(nums1 == nums2)  # True\n",
    "print(nums1 != nums2)  # False\n",
    "print(nums1 <= nums3)  # True\n",
    "print(nums2 >= nums3)  # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The corresponding elements of `nums1` and `nums2` above are exactly the same, so the result of the `==` operation is `True`. The comparison of `nums2` and `nums3`, because the first element `1` of `nums2` is less than the first element `3` of `nums3`, the result of the comparison `nums2 >= nums3` is `False`. The relational operation between two lists is not so common in actual work. If you really don't understand it, just skip it and don't worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversal of elements\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to take out the elements in the list one by one, you can use the `for-in` loop. There are two ways to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 1: Traverse the list elements through index operations in the loop structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Kotlin']\n",
    "for index in range(len(languages)):\n",
    "    print(languages[index])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python\n",
    "Java\n",
    "C++\n",
    "Kotlin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The `len` function above can get the number of list elements `N`, and `range(N)` constitutes the range from `0` to `N-1`, which can be used as the index of the list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2: Loop the list directly, and the loop variable represents the list elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Kotlin']\n",
    "for language in languages:\n",
    "    print(language)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Summarize\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we can use the knowledge of lists to reconstruct the above code of \"rolling the dice to count the number of times each point appears\".\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Roll a dice 6000 times and count the number of times each number appears.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "counters = [0] * 6\n",
    "#Simulate dice rolling and record the number of times each point appears\n",
    "for _ in range(6000):\n",
    "    face = random.randrange(1, 7)\n",
    "    counters[face - 1] += 1\n",
    "# Output the number of times each point appears\n",
    "for face in range(1, 7):\n",
    "    print(f'{face} point appears {counters[face - 1]} times')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we use the six elements in the `counters` list to represent the number of times 1 to 6 appear. At the beginning, the values of the six elements are all 0. Next, we use a random number uniformly distributed from 1 to 6 to simulate rolling a dice. If 1 is rolled, the value of `counters[0]` increases by 1. If 2 is rolled, the value of `counters[1]` increases by 1, and so on. You can feel that due to the use of list types and loop structures, we process data in batches, which makes the modified code much simpler and more elegant than the previous code."
