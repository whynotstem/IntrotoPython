    "### List Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "List type variables have many methods that can help us operate a list. Suppose we have a list named foos and the list has a method named bar. The syntax for using the list method is foos.bar(). This is a syntax for calling an object method through an object reference. When we talk about object-oriented programming later, we will explain this syntax in detail. This syntax is also called sending a message to an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding and removing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "List is a mutable container, which means we can add elements to the container, remove elements from the container, and modify the elements in the existing container. We can use the list's `append` method to append elements to the list, and use the `insert` method to insert elements into the list. Appending means adding elements to the end of the list, while inserting means adding new elements at a specified position. You can take a look at the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']\n",
    "languages.append('JavaScript')\n",
    "print(languages)  # ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "languages.insert(1, 'SQL')\n",
    "print(languages)  # ['Python', 'SQL', 'Java', 'C++', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the `remove` method of the list to delete the specified element from the list. It should be noted that if the element to be deleted is not in the list, a `ValueError` error will be raised, causing the program to crash. Therefore, it is recommended that you use the member operation mentioned earlier to make a judgment before deleting elements. We can also use the `pop` method to delete elements from the list. The `pop` method deletes the last element in the list by default. Of course, you can also give a position and delete the element at the specified position. When using the `pop` method to delete elements, if the index value is out of range, an `IndexError` exception will be raised, causing the program to crash. In addition, the list also has a `clear` method that can clear the elements in the list. The code is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "languages = ['Python', 'SQL', 'Java', 'C++', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "if 'Java' in languages:\n",
    "    languages.remove('Java')\n",
    "if 'Swift' in languages:\n",
    "    languages.remove('Swift')\n",
    "print(languages)  # ['Python', 'SQL', C++', 'JavaScript']\n",
    "languages.pop()\n",
    "temp = languages.pop(1)\n",
    "print(temp)       # SQL\n",
    "languages.append(temp)\n",
    "print(languages)  # ['Python', C++', 'SQL']\n",
    "languages.clear()\n",
    "print(languages)  # []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: `pop` method will get the deleted element when deleting an element. In the above code, we assign the element deleted by `pop` method to the variable named `temp`. Of course, if you want, you can also add this element to the list again, just like the above code `languages.append(temp)` does.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a small problem here. For example, if there are multiple `'Python'` in the `languages` list, then when we use `languages.remove('Python')`, do we delete all `'Python'` or the first `'Python'`? You can guess first and then try it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually another way to delete elements from a list, which is to use the `del` keyword in Python followed by the element to be deleted. This approach is no different from using the `pop` method to specify the index to delete the element, but the latter will return the deleted element. The former has a slightly better performance because the underlying bytecode instruction corresponding to `del` is `DELETE_SUBSCR`, and the underlying bytecode instructions corresponding to `pop` are `CALL_METHOD` and `POP_TOP`. If you donâ€™t understand it, just ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']\n",
    "del items[1]\n",
    "print(items)  # ['Python', 'C++']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Element position and frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The `index` method of a list can be used to find the index position of an element in the list. If the specified element cannot be found, the `index` method will cause a `ValueError` error; the `count` method of a list can be used to count the number of times an element appears in the list. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = ['Python', 'Java', 'Java', 'C++', 'Kotlin', 'Python']\n",
    "print(items.index('Python'))     # 0\n",
    "# Start searching for 'Python' at index position 1\n",
    "print(items.index('Python', 1))  # 5\n",
    "print(items.count('Python'))     # 2\n",
    "print(items.count('Kotlin'))     # 1\n",
    "print(items.count('Swfit'))      # 0\n",
    "# Start searching for 'Java' at index position 3\n",
    "print(items.index('Java', 3))    # ValueError: 'Java' is not in list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting and reversing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sort` operation of a list can sort the elements of the list, while the `reverse` operation can reverse the elements. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Kotlin', 'Swift']\n",
    "items.sort()\n",
    "print(items)  # ['C++', 'Java', 'Kotlin', 'Python', 'Swift']\n",
    "items.reverse()\n",
    "print(items)  # ['Swift', 'Python', 'Kotlin', 'Java', 'C++']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lists can also be created using a special literal syntax called a comprehension. Below, we use an example to illustrate the benefits of using list comprehensions to create lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 1: Create a list of numbers ranging from 1 to 99 that are divisible by 3 or 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = []\n",
    "for i in range(1, 100):\n",
    "    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:\n",
    "        items.append(i)\n",
    "print(items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the same thing using list comprehension, the code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "items = [i for i in range(1, 100) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0]\n",
    "print(items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 2: There is an integer list `nums1`, create a new list `nums2`, the elements in `nums2` are the squares of the corresponding elements in `nums1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [35, 12, 97, 64, 55]\n",
    "nums2 = []\n",
    "for num in nums1:\n",
    "    nums2.append(num ** 2)\n",
    "print(nums2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the same thing using list comprehension, the code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [35, 12, 97, 64, 55]\n",
    "nums2 = [num ** 2 for num in nums1]\n",
    "print(nums2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario 3: There is an integer list `nums1`, create a new list `nums2`, and put the elements in `nums1` that are greater than `50` into `nums2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [35, 12, 97, 64, 55]\n",
    "nums2 = []\n",
    "for num in nums1:\n",
    "    if num > 50:\n",
    "        nums2.append(num)\n",
    "print(nums2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To do the same thing using list comprehension, the code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers1 = [35, 12, 97, 64, 55]\n",
    "nums2 = [num for num in nums1 if num > 50]\n",
    "print(nums2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using list generation to create a list is not only simple and elegant, but also has better performance than using the `for-in` loop and the `append` method to append elements to an empty list. Why is generation better performance? That's because there are instructions specifically for generation in the bytecode instructions of the Python interpreter (`LIST_APPEND` instruction); while the `for` loop adds elements to the list by calling methods (`LOAD_METHOD` and `CALL_METHOD` instructions), and the method call itself is a relatively time-consuming operation. It doesn't matter if you don't understand this point, just remember the conclusion that \"**It is strongly recommended to use generation syntax to create lists**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not limit the elements in a list to be of the same data type, which means that the elements in a list can be of any data type, including the list itself. If the elements in a list are also lists, then we can call it a nested list. Nested lists can be used to represent tables or mathematical matrices. For example, if we want to save the grades of 5 students in 3 courses, we can use the list shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = [[95, 83, 92], [80, 75, 82], [92, 97, 90], [80, 78, 69], [65, 66, 89]]\n",
    "print(scores[0])\n",
    "print(scores[0][1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the nested lists above, each element is equivalent to the grades of a student in three courses, for example, `[95, 83, 92]`, and `83` in this list represents the grade of a certain course of this student. If you want to access this value, you can use two index operations `scores[0][1]`, where `scores[0]` can get the list `[95, 83, 92]`, and use the index operation `[1]` again to get the second element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to enter the grades of 5 students in 3 courses through keyboard input and save them in a list, you can use the code shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scores = []\n",
    "for _ in range(5):\n",
    "    temp = []\n",
    "    for _ in range(3):\n",
    "        score = int(input('Please enter: '))\n",
    "        temp.append(score)\n",
    "    scores.append(temp)\n",
    "print(scores)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to generate the grades of 5 students in 3 courses by generating random numbers and save them in a list, we can use the list generation formula. The code is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "scores = [[random.randrange(60, 101) for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(5)]\n",
    "print(scores)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The above code `[random.randrange(60, 101) for _ in range(3)]` can generate a list of 3 random integers. We put this code in another list generation formula as an element of the list. A total of 5 such elements are generated, and finally a nested list is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application of List\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will use an example of random number selection for the Double Color Ball to explain the application of the list. The Double Color Ball is a lottery ticket issued by the China Welfare Lottery Issuing and Management Center. Each bet consists of 6 red balls and 1 blue ball. The red ball numbers are selected from 1 to 33, and the blue ball numbers are selected from 1 to 16. Each bet requires the selection of 6 red ball numbers and 1 blue ball number, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"res/day09/lottery.png\" style=\"zoom:85%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: There is a very interesting discussion on the nature of various forms of lottery in China on Zhihu. I would like to share it with you: \"**A person who gets something for nothing is invented to deceive a group of people who want to get something for nothing, and finally feed a group of people who really get something for nothing**\". Many people who have no concept of probability even think that the probability of winning or losing the lottery is 50%; many people think that if the probability of winning is 1%, then you will definitely win if you buy 100 times. These are all very absurd ideas. Therefore, **cherish life and stay away from gambling, especially if you know nothing about probability**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use a Python program to generate a set of random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Double Color Ball Random Number Selection Program\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "red_balls = list(range(1, 34))\n",
    "selected_balls = []\n",
    "# Add 6 red balls to the selected list\n",
    "for _ in range(6):\n",
    "    # Generate a random integer to represent the index position of the selected red ball\n",
    "    index = random.randrange(len(red_balls))\n",
    "    # Remove the selected ball from the red ball list and add it to the selected list\n",

    "# Randomly select a blue ball\n",
    "blue_ball = random.randrange(1, 17)\n",
    "# Output the selected blue ball\n",
    "print(f'\\033[034m{blue_ball:0>2d}\\033[0m')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explanation**: In the above code, `print(f'\\033[0m...\\033[0m')` is used to control the color of the output content. The red ball is output in red, and the blue ball is output in blue. The ellipsis represents the content we want to output. `\\033[0m` is a control code, which means turning off all attributes, which means that the previous control code will be invalid. You can also simply understand it as a delimiter. The `0` before `m` means the display mode of the console is the default value. `0` can be omitted, `1` means highlight, `5` means flashing, `7` means reverse display, etc. Between `0` and `m`, we can write numbers representing colors, such as `30` for black, `31` for red, `32` for green, `33` for yellow, `34` for blue, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also simplify the above code by using the `sample` and `choice` functions provided by the `random` module. The former can implement random sampling without replacement, and the latter can implement random selection of an element. The modified code is as follows.\n",

    "The underlying layer of a list in Python is an array that can be expanded dynamically. List elements are stored continuously in computer memory, so random access is possible (getting the corresponding element through a valid index and the operation time is independent of the number of list elements). We can temporarily ignore these underlying storage details, and we donâ€™t need to understand the asymptotic time complexity of each method of the list (the relationship between the time it takes to execute the method and the number of list elements). I think it is more important for everyone to learn to use lists to solve problems at work."
