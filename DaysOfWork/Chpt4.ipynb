    "## Branch and loop structure in action\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last two lessons, you’ve gotten a basic understanding of Python’s branch (if/else) and loop (for/while) structures. These are very important because they form the foundation of how programs make decisions and repeat actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they can also be challenging for beginners. Many people understand the syntax, but feel stuck when trying to solve real problems. It’s common to understand someone else’s code but struggle to write your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past, many beginners struggled with applying these concepts to real problems — they might understand the syntax but still feel unsure about where to start. Today, with the help of large language models (LLMs), getting started has become much easier. You no longer need to figure everything out alone — tools like LLMs can help guide your thinking, generate code, and explain how things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even with this powerful assistance, practice still matters. The more you explore and work with code — even when using an LLM — the stronger your understanding becomes. Over time, you’ll gain confidence not just in reading and using code, but in shaping it to solve problems your own way. Let the LLM be your learning partner, and keep coding — your skills will grow with each step!\n",

    "\n",
    "Requirements: Output the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explanation**: The Fibonacci sequence, also commonly known as the golden section sequence, was introduced by Italian mathematician Leonardo da Fibonacci in his book The Book of Calculation to study the growth rate of rabbits under ideal assumptions. Therefore, this sequence is often jokingly called the \"rabbit sequence\". The characteristic of the Fibonacci sequence is that the first two numbers in the sequence are both 1, and starting from the third number, each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. According to this rule, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55`. The Fibonacci sequence has direct applications in modern physics, quasi-crystal structure, chemistry and other fields.\n",

    "Output the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence\n",

    "    a, b = b, a + b\n",
    "    print(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Explanation**: `a, b = b, a + b` in the above loop means assigning the value of variable `b` to `a`, and assigning the value of `a + b` to `b`. Through this recursive formula, we can get the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence one by one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Requirement: Find all the daffodil numbers between 100 and 999.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: In number theory, a narcissistic number is also called a super-perfect digital invariant number, a narcissistic number, a self-power number, or an Armstrong number. It is a $\\small{N}$ non-negative integer whose $\\small{N}$ power sum of its digits is exactly equal to the number itself. For example: $\\small{153 = 1^{3} + 5^{3} + 3^{3}}$ , so 153 is a narcissistic number; $\\small{1634 = 1^{4} + 6^{4} + 3^{4} + 4^{4}}$ , so 1634 is also a narcissistic number. For a three-digit number, the key to solving the problem is to split it into units, tens, and hundreds, and then determine whether it meets the requirements of a narcissistic number. This is actually very easy to do using the `//` and `%` operators in Python.\n",

    "The trick of using `//` and `%` to split a number is still very common when writing code. If we want to reverse a positive integer with unknown digits, such as turning 12389 into 98321, we can also use these two operations to achieve it. The code is as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Explanation**: One hundred coins for one hundred chickens is a math problem proposed by Zhang Qiujian, an ancient Chinese mathematician, in his book Mathematical Classics: One rooster is worth five coins, one hen is worth three coins, and three chicks are worth one coin. If you buy one hundred chickens with one hundred coins, how many roosters, hens, and chicks are there? Translated into modern Chinese, it means: A rooster costs five dollars, a hen costs three dollars, and three chicks cost one dollar. If you buy one hundred chickens with 100 dollars, how many roosters, hens, and chicks are there?\n",

    "    for y in range(0, 34):\n",
    "        for z in range(0, 100, 3):\n",
    "            if x + y + z == 100 and 5 * x + 3 * y + z // 3 == 100:\n",
    "                print(f'Roosters: {x}, hens: {y}, chicks: {z}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used above is called **exhaustive method**, also known as **brute force search method**. This method lists all possible candidates in the alternative solutions one by one, and checks whether each candidate meets the description of the problem, and finally gets the solution to the problem. In the above code, we use a nested loop structure. Suppose there are `x` roosters. Obviously, the value range of `x` is 0 to 20. Suppose there are `y` hens. Its value range is 0 to 33. Suppose there are `z` chicks. Its value range is 0 to 99 and its value is a multiple of 3. In this way, we set the condition of 100 chickens `x + y + z == 100`, and set the condition of 100 dollars `5 * x + 3 * y + z // 3 == 100`. When both conditions are met at the same time, it is the correct answer to the problem. We use the `print` function to output it. This approach may seem clumsy, but it is usually a feasible or even good option for computers with very powerful computing power, as long as the solution to the problem exists, it can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there is a better way to write the above code. Since we have assumed that there are `x` roosters and `y` hens, the number of chicks should be `100 - x - y`. By reducing one condition, we can rewrite the three-layer nested `for-in` loop above into a two-layer nested `for-in` loop. With the number of loops reduced, the execution efficiency of the code has been significantly improved, as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Description**: CRAPS, also known as Citi Craps, is a very popular table gambling game in Las Vegas, USA. The game uses two dice, and players play by shaking two dice to get points. The simplified rules are: if the player shakes 7 or 11 points for the first time, the player wins; if the player shakes 2, 3 or 12 points for the first time, the dealer wins; if the player shakes other points, the game continues, the player shakes the dice again, if the player shakes 7 points, the dealer wins; if the player shakes the points shaken for the first time, the player wins; the player continues to shake the dice for other points until the winner is determined. In order to increase the fun of the code, we set the player to have a bet of 1,000 dollars at the beginning of the game. Before each game starts, the player places a bet first. If the player wins, he can get a reward corresponding to the bet amount. If the dealer wins, the player will lose the amount of his bet. The condition for the end of the game is that the player goes bankrupt (loses all the bets).\n",
